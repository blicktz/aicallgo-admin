# Phase 3 Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you test the newly implemented Phase 3 features for the admin board.

## What Was Implemented

Phase 3 adds critical admin capabilities for managing user entitlements and credits:

1. **Feature Entitlement Management** (`pages/6_‚ö°_Entitlements.py`)
   - Grant/revoke feature access to users
   - View plan-based features and overrides
   - Set expiration dates on overrides
   - Delete overrides to revert to plan defaults
   - Full audit trail in notes field

2. **Credit Adjustment** (`pages/7_üí∞_Credits.py`)
   - View user credit balance breakdown
   - View transaction history
   - Adjust credits (add/deduct)
   - Preview adjustments before applying
   - Large amount and negative balance warnings
   - Full audit trail in transaction metadata

3. **Supporting Services**
   - `services/audit_service.py` - Audit logging
   - `services/entitlement_service.py` - Entitlement operations
   - `services/credit_service.py` - Credit operations

## Prerequisites

Before testing Phase 3, ensure:

1. **Phase 1 & 2 are working**
   - Authentication is functional
   - Database connection is established
   - Basic pages (Dashboard, Users, Businesses, etc.) are accessible

2. **Database Access**
   - Port-forward to staging database is running:
     ```bash
     export KUBECONFIG=~/staging-kubeconfig.txt
     kubectl port-forward svc/postgres 5432:5432 -n aicallgo-staging
     ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   - `.streamlit/secrets.toml` has `ADMIN_USERNAME` set
   - Database connection string is configured

## Audit Trail Verification

### Check Entitlement Audit Trail

1. After creating an override, view it in "Active Overrides"
2. Click "View notes" expander
3. Verify notes contain:
   - `[ADMIN: {username} @ {timestamp}]` prefix
   - Your entered notes
   - ISO timestamp

### Check Credit Audit Trail

1. Use database tools or web-backend API to query:
   ```sql
   SELECT transaction_metadata
   FROM credit_transactions
   WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

2. Verify metadata JSON contains:
   - `admin_username`: Your admin username
   - `admin_reason`: Your entered reason
   - `adjustment_type`: "manual_admin"
   - `source`: "admin_board"
   - `timestamp`: ISO timestamp

## Transaction Safety Verification

### Test Rollback on Error

1. **Manual Test**: Temporarily break database connection
   - Stop port-forward: `Ctrl+C` on kubectl port-forward
   - Try to create an override or adjustment
   - Expected: Error message, no partial updates

2. **Check Database State**: After error, verify:
   - No new overrides created
   - No new transactions created
   - No balance updates
   - Database state unchanged

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "User not found" error

**Solution**:
- Verify user ID is correct
- Ensure user is active
- Check database connection

### Issue: "Feature not found" error

**Solution**:
- Verify feature exists in database
- Check `app/core/startup.py` in web-backend for valid feature keys
- Run web-backend migrations if features are missing

### Issue: Transaction rollback without clear error

**Solution**:
- Check admin board logs in terminal
- Look for `IntegrityError` or constraint violations
- Verify unique constraints (e.g., one override per user-feature pair)

### Issue: Audit trail not showing

**Solution**:
- Verify `ADMIN_USERNAME` is set in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
- Check logs for audit service errors

### Issue: Page doesn't refresh after mutation

**Solution**:
- Clear Streamlit cache manually: Click "üîÑ Refresh"
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Restart Streamlit if needed

## Performance Expectations

All operations should complete within:

- **User search**: < 500ms
- **Load entitlements**: < 1 second
- **Load credit balance**: < 500ms
- **Create override**: < 2 seconds
- **Adjust credits**: < 2 seconds
- **Page refresh**: < 2 seconds

If operations are slower, check:
- Database connection latency
- Port-forward stability
- Query complexity

## Next Steps

After successfully testing Phase 3:

1. **Report Issues**: Document any bugs or unexpected behavior
2. **User Acceptance Testing**: Have team members test workflows
3. **Phase 4**: Move on to implementing:
   - Promotion tracking
   - Appointment viewing
   - System monitoring
   - CSV exports
   - Enhanced refresh capabilities

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check logs in terminal running Streamlit
- Review Phase 3 implementation plan: `docs/PHASE_3_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Check web-backend models and CRUD operations
- Verify database schema matches expectations
